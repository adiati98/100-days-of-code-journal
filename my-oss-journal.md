  - Added steps to update the `table-of-contents.md` in the "Tips for making the most out of #100DaysOfOSS" section.

### ‚ú® Contribution

#### [Virtual Coffee IO](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io)

  - Created a [draft pull request](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io/pull/952) for the monthly challenge. A draft is necessary because we're still waiting for the blogpost to be published and include it in the PR.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - There's no proper docs about how to update the monthly challenges except the way to navigate to the file that needs to be updated. So I had to take a look at previous issues and pull requests. Time for updating the docs üòÑ!
