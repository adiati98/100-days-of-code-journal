- **Challenges faced**:
  - It's more of a curiosity than a challenge. I read that we can have multiple PR templates that we can store in the `.github` folder. But when I tried, not any of them show in the PR form. It might needs the query parameters, but I couldn't find any resources on how to do it yet.

I thought I could edit and fix the date later from the calendar icon available so I can reorder the highlights based on the date of creation. But changing the date doesn't change the order üòï. I might create an issue if I don't see any issue or PR mentioning this.

I hope I didn't make duplicate issue üòÖ. This is one of the reasons I often feel hesitate to create an issue on a repo that I'm not familiar with üò£. But, hey, I'm learning üòÑ.
