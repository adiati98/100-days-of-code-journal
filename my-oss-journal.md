I hope I didn't make duplicate issue üòÖ. This is one of the reasons I often feel hesitate to create an issue on a repo that I'm not familiar with üò£. But, hey, I'm learning üòÑ.

## Day 36 <br> _27/08/2023_

### ‚ú® Contribution

#### [Virtual-Coffee / virtualcoffee.io](https://github.com/Virtual-Coffee/virtualcoffee.io)

- **Description**: Continue with fixing VC docs.
- **Tasks completed**:
  - Working on fixing links.
- **Challenges faced**:

  Remembering that it's only a few days away from September, I don't think I will finish fixing the docs on time. And I need the September & October challenges to be fixed so they can be up for Preptember and Hacktoberfest.

  The problem is, if I create new branch just to fix and push the Sept & Oct pages, all commits that I made in the current branch will be included in this push. The reason is because I haven't pushed the current changes to the remote repo. Deleting current branch is not an option because _I already finished fixing 17 pages out of 29_. I don't want to throw them away and start from scratch.

  I couldn't find any solution to push only the commits in the new branch and not including the commits in the current branch. So, for now, I copy and pasted all files that I've fixed and saved them in another workspace, then I deleted the current branch. I will copy and paste them when I work on them. I'm gonna work on the Sept and Oct pages tomorrow to get them up and running before Preptember.

  - Setup the local environment ‚Äî install dependencies
- **Challenges faced**:
  - The installation process got canceled for the first time. From the error message, I found out that I have `node` version 19 installed in my computer while this project is using version 18.17.0 or >=20.5.0. So I had to uninstall and reinstall `node` version 18.17.0.
  - It took a while to install all dependencies (almost 20 min!). I suspect this is Windows thing. üòÜ
  - When I opened the `localhost:3000`, I only got pizza icon. I looked up in the README, there is no instruction which path I should navigate to. So I took initiative to go to `/insights`. And it worked! I will create an issue for this.
